# Salesforce: Map Leads Near Me
> Code created to highlight a real-world use for Salesforce Geocoding functionality

Salesforce introduced [automatic geocoding of addresses as part of the Summer '16 release](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer16/release-notes/rn_general_geocodes_aloha.htm). This repository accompanies the following two blog posts I have written to explain how a simple map-based Lightning application can be used to bring this functionality to the surface:

* [Plot Your Salesforce Leads on a Map](http://aaronallport.com/2016/08/04/plot-your-salesforce-leads-on-a-map.html)
* [New and Improved Salesforce Leads on a Map](http://aaronallport.com/2016/09/14/new-and-improved-salesforce-leads-on-a-map.html)

In this repository you'll find the code for the Lightning component and server-side Apex controller. Enjoy!
