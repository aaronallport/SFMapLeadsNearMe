# Salesforce: Map Leads Near Me
> Code created to highlight a real-world use for Salesforce Geocoding functionality

Salesforce introduced [automatic geocoding of addresses as part of the Summer '16 release](https://releasenotes.docs.salesforce.com/en-us/summer16/release-notes/rn_general_geocodes_aloha.htm). This repository accompanies the following two blog posts I have written to explain how a simple map-based Lightning application can be used to bring this functionality to the surface:

To accompany [this talk](https://success.salesforce.com/Sessions?eventId=a1Q3000000qQOd9#/session/a2q3A000000LBhyQAG) given at [Dreamforce 2016](https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF16/), here are the resources mentioned in the slides:

In this repository you'll find the code for the Lightning component and server-side Apex controller mentioned in the presentation.

Enjoy, go forth, and create amazing things with the power of automatic geocoding in Salesforce!
